                <p className='largeBody'>
                    Born in Southern California, raised evenly between California & Texas, and now living in the Bay Area. 
                    Iâ€™m a self-taught designer whoâ€™s interested in solving complex problems by humanizing tech & 
                    <span className='bolded'> exploring the intersection between psychology, technology, and design</span>. 
                    Right now, Iâ€™m a senior studying Cognitive Science & Design Innovation at UC Berkeley. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I hope to 
                    <span className='bolded'> design & develop for impact </span> 
                    â€” making meaningful, diverse products and experiences that improve peopleâ€™s 
                    lives. That includes using my own personal background as a Hispanic, first-gen, woman in STEM and personal values 
                    to guide my open-minded, empathetic approach to designing. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Additionally, Iâ€™ve always been curious to understand how 
                    things (and people) work, and why they work that way. This curiosity has driven me to explore ways to make technology 
                    more accessible, inclusive, equitable, and empowering to everyone. With this, Iâ€™m committed to building for causes that 
                    Iâ€™m passionate about as well as promoting diversity within tech. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    When Iâ€™m not designing, you can find me with my dog, making monthly
